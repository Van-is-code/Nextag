      name: "GG JACKIE 1961 SUPER MINI BAG",
      products_image: gucci1kem,
      images: [gucci1kem,gucci1tim,gucci1xanh,gucci1den],
      price: 1750,
      brand: "Gucci",
      styles: "Handheld",
      origin: "Italy",
      dimension: "27 x 16 x 5 cm",
      material: "Leather",
      review: `
        First released by Gucci in the 1950s as the "Constance," this early hobo-style bag was never not seen \nunder former first lady Jackie Kennedy’s arm—to the point that the brand renamed the style after her. And just like that, an icon was born! This fall, Gucci has reissued this bag (in classic monogram canvas with signature red and green web detailing as well as pastel hues the colors of Jordan almonds) and in a range of more contemporary sizes: medium, small, and mini. We tried out the small in a creamy white.
        Let’s Break Down the Facts
        The leather is sturdy, but not too supple, which means it won’t scuff easily and will retain a firm shape (if stored properly, of course). Great news for anyone who is feeling it in white!
        The signature “piston” clasp is the only real hardware on the bag, resulting in a clean and classic design. The bag is equipped with a removable and adjustable strap, so it can be worn several ways—handheld, tucked right under your arm, as a crossbody, and as a shoulder bag—making it extremely versatile.
        The small size definitely accommodates the essentials (wallet, phone, keys, lipstick and mask), with a little room to spare. It can easily transition from a professional day bag with a shorts suit to an easy, hands-free crossbody for weekend errands in jeans and a sweater—and when worn with a sexy knit dress, it makes for a polished evening accessory.
        The Bottom Line
        The Jackie is a classic investment bag. It’s been coveted by style icons for nearly 50 years and has remained a signature style at the fashion house. The size is ideal for anywhere you’d hope to wear it and the sturdy leather (or logo canvas) will definitely hold up over the years.
